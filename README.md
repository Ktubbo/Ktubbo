- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ktubbo. My name is Hubert and someday I want to be a Java Developer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in java development and software architecture. Also I'm interested in sailing, playing guitar and 3D modeling/3D printing. I love sharing knowledge, 
so I am tutoring high school math and physics for free.
- ðŸŒ± Things I did to get closer to becoming a Java Developer:
    - I finished my bootcamp "Java Developer Plus", which took me a lot of effort to finish it. It took about 720 hours over 9 months.
      - 1st project which I made by myself was simple commandline game, Rock-Paper-Scisors with additional 2 symbols Spock and Lizard.
        -> https://github.com/Ktubbo/Hubert_Rusinek-Kodilla-Java/tree/master/kodilla-rps/src/main/java/com/kodilla
      - 2nd project was Don't Get Angry game, where I used JavaFX for GUI. 
        -> https://github.com/Ktubbo/Hubert_Rusinek-DGA-Game
      - 3rd project was a Sudoku solver.
        -> https://github.com/Ktubbo/Hubert_Rusinek-Kodilla-Java/tree/master/kodilla-sudoku/src/main/java/com/kodilla/sudoku
      - 4th project was a REST api for library management, where I used SpringBoot (Data JPA, Data JDBC, WEB), lombok and two databases (H2 for tests, MySQL 
      for application perposes).
        -> https://github.com/Ktubbo/kodilla-library
      - 5th project was a team project where the main goal was to try teamwork. We worked asynchronously in a some kind of hybrid agile approach. We were using JIRA 
      canban, but we had weekly meetings to summarize progress, draw conclusions and plan next steps of project implementation and Daily instant messaging 
      "meetings" to help keep track of task status and progress of other team members. We performed code reviews and used CircleCI for continous integration.
      We also created documentation using Swagger.
        -> https://github.com/interceptor2048/projekt-jdp-2102-01
      - 6th project was a REST API that met 3 levels of maturity developed by Leonard Richardson. This project was made to learn how to use open API from other services
      (Trello) and connect it with my application. It has scheduled daily mail with a current tasks. It is using postgreSQL and it is deployed on Heroku.
        -> https://github.com/Ktubbo/REST_API
        -> https://ktubbo.github.io/
      - 7th was a graduate project which had to be an application based on the REST API and including a view layer. The project had to meet the specifications, such as: 
        - Created at least 20 different endpoints.
        - Used each of the HTTP methods learned at least once: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
        - Use at least two external data sources.
        - Invent and implement at least one use of the scheduler.
        - Implement at least 10 different operations for writing data to the database.
        - Create tests that cover at least 65% of the code.
        - Use at least two different design patterns.
        - Use the Vaadin library to create a view layer for your application.
        
        The allotted time for this project was 4 weeks. Every point in this specification has been met on time. Firstly, I needed to create Entity Relationship Diagram.
        Secondly I made classes that are responsible for entities, DTOs, then mappers, repositories, database services, excepions and controllers. Then I started to make
        views in Vaadin which was quite challenging. It took me the longest time to write unit tests. Last thing was to find some data source on RapidApi and implement
        it in my application.

  Updated (25.09.21)
        
  - I changed my daily habbits to gain development knowledge. Every day I listen to podcast DevTalk by Maciej Aniserowicz in my car, instead of listen to music. I read
  every day reddit.com/r/java/ for tech news in Java, instead of scrolling socialmedia platforms.
  
  - Recently I bought a domain www.rusinek.net, where I will be bloging about my projects and mistakes.
  
  - I develop new cross-platform project, messenger bot. Using Selenium Web Driver, Spring Web, Spring Boot and Raspberry Pi. Which sends me infomration on facebook messenger about GPU prices.
  
  - I have plans to develop my Java skills in the near future:
    - [x] I want to start blogging. I am aware that there is a lot of development blogs, but writing your own blog involves putting your thoughts into words, forces you to 
    write down your mistakes, gives you the opportunity to put your problems into perspective, and helps develop english skills.
    - [ ] I want to develop application using microservices architecture.
    - [x] I want to develop facebook messenger bot (using Heroku and Selenium WebDriver), to inform me and my friends about computer equipment sales.
    - [ ] I want to contribute in some open source project.
